        <recommendation type="For Fans" uid="713767">I recommend this movie to all SAO-Fans. In my Opinion it is far
            better than the Series. It`s a nice balance of everything you would like to see in an SAO-Movie.
        </recommendation>
        <recommendation type="For Fans" uid="219363">SAO never had a great battles or story, but it had likeable
            characters and well established border between virtual reality and real life. The second season had many
            flaws, but I really liked it as it developed the characters, their passions and struggles to adapt to normal
            life.

            I find that this balance was lost in Ordinal Scale, it does not develop the characters or the setting. The
            audience is more mature now, but the movie itself isn`t.

            As a fan I really liked it for what it was, a love letter to SAO fans and a teaser for Season 3. I have high
            expectations of Alicization, as this arc does exactly what I crave from a SAO sequel.
        </recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Recommended" uid="97395">It`s a good continuation of the Series. It`s nothing new, as
            expected after 2 seasons, but I was happy to see these lovable characters again. Some of them have very few
            screentime, but it was worth my time.
        </recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Recommended" uid="136010">I went in expecting nothing and almost skipped the movie because
            some recommendations said its not needed for the third season but I ended up watching it anyways. Totally
            worth it. I very much enjoyed the movie. Fantastic fight scenes, good soundtrack and an okay story fitting
            to the franchise.
        </recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Recommended" uid="478777">So this movie had a lot going on for it: excellent animation and
            visually pleasing action, interesting plot, Asuna x Kirito sweet moments, Asuna`s sideboob zoomed in and in
            its full glory...But I guess the most important thing was the absolute cocktease of a a final scene
            introducing Alicization.

            Yeah I am quite content with this movie. Defo recommended! (p.s: It does require previous knowledge of
            everything that happened so far)

    <description>* Based on http://anidb.net/cr28670 [Kawahara Reki]`s light novel series Sword Art Online.
        In 2022, the world of virtual reality was upended by the arrival of a new invention from a genius programmer,
        http://anidb.net/ch43412 [Kayaba Akihiko]. Called NerveGear, it was the first full-dive system and with it, came
        endless possibilities to VRMMORPGs.
        In 2026, a new machine called the Augma is developed to compete against the NerveGear and its successor, the
        Amusphere. A next-gen wearable device, the Augma doesn`t have a full-dive function like its predecessors.
        Instead, it uses Augmented Reality (AR) to get players into the game. It is safe, user-friendly and lets users
        play while they are conscious, making it an instant hit on the market. The most popular game on the system is
        Ordinal Scale (aka: OS), an ARMMORPG developed exclusively for the Augma.
        http://anidb.net/ch49857 [Asuna] and the gang have already been playing OS for a while, by the time
        http://anidb.net/ch46771 [Kirito] decides to join them. They`re about to find out that Ordinal Scale isn`t all
        fun and games...

            <description>The content indicators branch is intended to be a less geographically specific tool than the
                `age rating` used by convention, for warning about things that might cause offence. Obviously there is
                still a degree of subjectivity involved, but hopefully it will prove useful for parents with delicate
                children, or children with delicate parents.

            <description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are:
                Plot Continuity
                How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing
                story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected
                episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
                Stereotype Characters
                Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your
                usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make
                much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite
                stereotype protagonists.
                Plot Twists
                Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that
                merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The
                latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable
                outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

            <name>fictional location</name>
            <description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common
                and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth,
                computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals,
                and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist
                with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
                A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the
                real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A
                good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such
                as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091
                [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China,
                Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet
                Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
                The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and
                setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
                A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but
                are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a
                parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet
                in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy
                worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.

            <name>nudity</name>
            <description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human
                characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for
                warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount
                of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more
                clothing is expected.
                Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page]
                for how to apply tag weights for content indicators.
                People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are
                relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or
                inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to
                disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people
                need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude
                or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a
                lifestyle.
                Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals
                are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people
                feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place
                can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting
                social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many
                people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency
                and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people
                regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
                Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It
                is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
                Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently
                without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

                guild of about thirty player, also called the strongest guild in Aincrad. Being one of the few many
                girls that play SAO, and even more so that she`s extremely pretty, she receives many invitations and
                proposals. She is a skilled player earning the Title "Flash" for her extraordinary sword skill. The KoB
                has assigned her two bodyguards, one of whom despises Kirito. Her game alias is the same as her Real
                World name. She later on falls in love with Kirito, eventually leading to them being married.

            <description>The main protagonist of the series. He is the protagonist and is a "solo" player, a player who
                hasn`t joined a guild and usually works alone. When it is announced that the players of Sword Art Online
                can no longer logout, he is surprised like everyone else, but unlike everyone else he quickly gets over
                it and accepts it, to an extent. He mainly uses a one-handed sword and usually wears all black in game,
                as it adds to stealth. He can also use two blades at once, a unique skill to him and he only uses it in
                emergencies to avoid attention for being one out of the two people to have unique skills. His game alias
                is Kirito, which is created by taking the syllables of the first and last Kanji of his real last and
                first names respectively: (Kirigaya Kazuto). In the real world, he lives with his mother and younger
                sister in a family of 3.

            <description>Kayaba Akihiko is the Director and creator of the Nerve Gear and Sword Art Online, as well as
                the main antagonist of the Sword Art Online arc. He traps all the players within Sword Art Online by
                using the Nerve Gear to cease sending signals to the users` body. Any in-game death or attempt at
                removal of the Nerve Gear would result in the real life death of the user. Later, it is discovered that
                he has been masquerading as Heathcliff, the leader of the Knights of the Blood Oath. Although he has the
                admin powers to make his avatar immortal, he is shown to be a powerful player even without his in-game
                immortality due to his intimate understanding of the SAO game mechanics which he himself had designed.
                He is defeated by Kirito at the end SAO arc, and at the end of ALO arc, leaves behind a program that
                grants Kirito the World Seed. His death was his own doing since he had also rigged his own Nerve Gear
                device to fry his brain when he was defeated and transferring his soul into a digital form.

                Salamanders led by General Eugene. At the same moment, Kirito flies in to challenge the general to a

                their attempt, saying that she is accompanying him to the World Tree. At the end of the arc, Lady Sakuya
                leads a combined force of Cait Sith and Sylph against the World Tree`s Guardians in an attempt to aid
                Kirito with the battle. After Kirito reached the top of the World Tree, she ordered her forces to pull
                back.
