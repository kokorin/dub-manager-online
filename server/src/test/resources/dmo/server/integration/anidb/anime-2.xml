        <recommendation type="Recommended" uid="508260">While this OVA is quite good, it only hits on pretty much the
            first Volume of a 40 Volume manga. Great introduction for those who have yet to try the 3x3 Eyes Manga, but
            definitely leaves you wanting more. This series beyond all other Manga I know should get a full series.

            <name>immortality</name>
            <description>Immortality is the ability to live in a physical or spiritual form for an infinite or
                inconceivably vast length of time. Humans, whose life span is limited and who die of age, disease and
                external trauma, have long sought ways to extend their lives; the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of
                the first great literary works created by mankind, is primarily the quest of a hero seeking to become
                immortal. The advances of science, in particular medicine and engineering, and especially in the last
                few centuries, have helped people extend their life span and may yet continue finding ways to do so.
                In fiction, immortals are not quite as uncommon as in real life, and the possible implications of
                endless or very long lives are often explored. Such implications include, but are not limited to:
                repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the
                mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves;
                and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that
                of a child. As such, while many may wish for immortality, it may be little more than a curse for the few
                who have it.

                and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed
                primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works
                goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.

            <name>dynamic</name>
            <description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are:
                Plot Continuity
                How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing
                story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected
                episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
                Stereotype Characters
                Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your
                usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make
                much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite
                stereotype protagonists.
                Plot Twists
                Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that
                merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The
                latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable
                outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

            <name>target audience</name>
            <description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both
                implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific
                sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band;
                not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their
                main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate
                the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated
                differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a
                title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or
                conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience
                categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer
                little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
                The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience
                into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the
                category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but
                comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most
                likely possibility.
                If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally
                shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the
                anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by
                the anime adaptation.

            <description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop
                against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life,
                Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but
                a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible
                tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

            <description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on
                manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
                It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on
                Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also
                it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and
                Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel
                Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

            <description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary
                element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where
                magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation
                that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great
                deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
                In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the
                worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however,
                fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and
                legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
                Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies,
                comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the
                structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on
                the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

            <description>The horror cinematic genre is characterized by the attempt to make the viewer experience dread,
                fear, terror, or horror. Often their plots involve the intrusion of an evil force, event or personage,
                sometimes of supernatural origin, on the mundane world and the consequences thereof.

                adhere to certain genre conventions, the emphasis on training and practice in preparation for
                competition, characters desire for self improvement, and pursuit of a specific goal.

            <name>death is cheap</name>
            <description>Important characters will have a terrible tendency to die dramatically, but will not, under any
                circumstances, stay dead. This tends to cheapen the dramatic death of a character to the point of being
                little more than a flesh wound if overused. If you ever hear passing mention of any form of afterlife in
                a series, be warned that the value of "dead" has become a whole lot less all of a sudden. Similarly, if
                the entire supporting cast is being killed off left and right, expect a resurrection by the end of the
                current arc. This trope became so common in some series that most people are more likely to be shocked
                if a character does not come back from the dead than when it does.

                damsel-in-distress role.

            <name>gore</name>
            <description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic
                portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive
                blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the
                theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider
                shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term
                "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of
                the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than
                to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

            <description>The last surviving Sanjiyan Unkara who was discovered by Yakumo`s father in Tibet. Yuzo Takada
                sometimes calls her the three-eyed elf girl from China, but she wears traditional Tibetan clothes. As is
                typical with members of her race, she developed a split personality as she grew older in order to cope
                with the problems of an exceptionally long life. However, Pai is the only Sanjiyan ever shown that has
                true multiple personality disorder.
                The Pai personality is somewhat flaky, but caring and cheerful. The two personae are aware of one
                another, and sometimes talk between themselves.

            <description>Undead (Pai`s "Wu").
                Yakumo`s father was an archaeology professor who went to Tibet to study the legend of the Sanjiyans, but
                died a natural death after he met Pai, while he was trying to get out of Yunnan (a province of China,
                near Tibet). Yakumo carries his father`s legacy: the promise to make Pai human.
                At the start of the story he is 17, but later had to quit high school due to the pressures of being an
                immortal. He worked part-time in Culture Shock, a gay bar in Shinjuku (he has no homosexual inclination,
                though). Later, he worked as an employee of Yougekisha.

                from which he can work from. She never misses an opportunity to wring every cent from some unfortunate
                person who stumbles across their paths, though.
                She had worked with Yakumo`s father and was in possession of the statue at the beginning of the series
                before she knew of its importance.

                prison. Before becoming a Wu, Benares was a powerful dragon monster who consumed various holy demons.
                This allowed him to absorb enough intelligence to eventually transform himself into the humanoid being
                we see today. Benares is a highly powerful figure within the demon world physically, magically, and
                politically, and strikes fear into even the bravest of souls.

                as an exchange student in England when it became obvious Yakumo was only interested in Pai.

            <summary>Yakumo Fugii, an ordinary Japanese student, inherits the care of Pai, a young girl from Nepal, from
                his dying archaeologist father. But Pai is more than she innocently appears to be. She is the last of a
                vanished magical race known as the Sanjiyan Unkara, or Triclops, and is in a desperate hunt against the
                forces of darkness to find the Ningen no Zou (Statue of Humanity) to turn her human. Yakumo nearly dies
                in a fight against a demon and to save him, Pai turns him into a Wu, a zombie bound to her service who
                cannot die. Yakumo and Pai travel to Hong Hong to meet with Ling Ling Lee, a colleague of his father`s,
                to track down the statue. But, the demons of the dark lord Kaiyan Wang are already there to retrieve
                it...whatever the cost.
