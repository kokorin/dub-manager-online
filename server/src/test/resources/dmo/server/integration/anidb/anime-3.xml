            <name>immortality</name>
            <description>Immortality is the ability to live in a physical or spiritual form for an infinite or
                inconceivably vast length of time. Humans, whose life span is limited and who die of age, disease and
                external trauma, have long sought ways to extend their lives; the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of
                the first great literary works created by mankind, is primarily the quest of a hero seeking to become
                immortal. The advances of science, in particular medicine and engineering, and especially in the last
                few centuries, have helped people extend their life span and may yet continue finding ways to do so.
                In fiction, immortals are not quite as uncommon as in real life, and the possible implications of
                endless or very long lives are often explored. Such implications include, but are not limited to:
                repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the
                mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves;
                and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that
                of a child. As such, while many may wish for immortality, it may be little more than a curse for the few
                who have it.

                and, by extension, to anime, especially manga-based ones. As the name implies, seinen works are marketed
                primarily to an audience of young men; the age range commonly understood to be the target of such works
                goes roughly from 17 to somewhere in the 40s.

            <name>amnesia</name>
            <description>The character suffers from some kind of amnesia (memory disturbance or loss). This may mean
                inability to memorize new information, or inability to recollect old memories. Since there are many
                types of memory, the person may e.g. forget who they are but still retain learned skills.
                Amnesia is fairly common in fiction as a plot device. In fact, because it allows for major plot changes
                while requiring little creativity from the author, it may be subject to heavy overuse.

            <name>dynamic</name>
            <description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are:
                Plot Continuity
                How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing
                story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected
                episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
                Stereotype Characters
                Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your
                usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make
                much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite
                stereotype protagonists.
                Plot Twists
                Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that
                merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The
                latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable
                outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

            <name>target audience</name>
            <description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both
                implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific
                sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band;
                not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their
                main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate
                the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated
                differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a
                title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or
                conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience
                categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer
                little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
                The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience
                into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the
                category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but
                comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most
                likely possibility.
                If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally
                shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the
                anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by
                the anime adaptation.

            <description>Themes describe the very central elements important to the anime stories. They set the backdrop
                against which the protagonists must face their challenges. Be it School Life, present Daily Life,
                Military action, Cyberpunk, Law and Order detective work, Sports, or the Underworld. These are only but
                a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible
                tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

            <description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight
                planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so
                most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans
                succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another
                while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of
                everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of
                course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little
                planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants
                it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day
                deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be
                it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy
                worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien
                invaders.

            <name>contemporary fantasy</name>
            <description>Contemporary fantasy, also known as modern fantasy or indigenous fantasy, is a sub-genre of
                fantasy, set in the present day. It is perhaps most popular for its sub-genre, urban fantasy.
                These terms are used to describe stories set in the putative real world (often referred to as consensus
                reality) in contemporary times, in which magic and magical creatures exist, either living in the
                interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds. It thus has much in common with, and
                sometimes overlaps with secret history; a work of fantasy in which the magic could not remain secret or
                does not have any known relationship to known history would not fit into this subgenre. Occasionally
                certain contemporary fantasy novels will make reference to pop culture.
                Novels in which modern characters travel into alternate worlds, and all the magical action takes place
                there (except for the portal required to transport them), are not considered contemporary fantasy. Thus,
                C.S. Lewis`s The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, where all fantasy events take place in the land of
                Narnia which is reached via a magic wardrobe, would not count as contemporary fantasy; on the other
                hand, the part of The Magician`s Nephew, where the Empress Jadis gets to London, tries to take over the
                Earth and clashes with police and a crowd of cockneys, would qualify as such.
                Contemporary fantasy is also to be distinguished from horror fiction, which also often has contemporary
                settings. When encountering magical events and creatures, the protagonist of a horror novel is
                horrified, while the protagonist of a fantasy novel (contemporary or otherwise) is filled with a sense
                of joy and wonder. Horrifying events may happen, but the fundamental distinction is vital.
                In his preface to That Hideous Strength, one of the earlier works falling within this sub-genre, C.S.
                Lewis explained why, when writing a tale about "magicians, devils, pantomime animals and planetary
                angels", he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow-minded academic politics at a
                provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers: "I am following the
                traditional fairy-tale. We do not always notice its method, because the cottages, castles, woodcutters
                and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to
                which it proceeds. But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales". The
                same is true for many of the later works in the genre, which often begin with a seemingly normal scene
                of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the
                scenes.

            <name>nudity</name>
            <description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human
                characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for
                warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount
                of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more
                clothing is expected.
                Note: Refer to further guidance on http://wiki.anidb.net/w/Categories:Content_Indicators [the Wiki page]
                for how to apply tag weights for content indicators. No frontal (visible genitals) = 1.5 stars or less.
                People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are
                relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or
                inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to
                disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people
                need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude
                or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a
                lifestyle.
                Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals
                are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people
                feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place
                can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting
                social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many
                people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency
                and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people
                regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
                Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It
                is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
                Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently
                without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

                manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
                It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on
                Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also
                it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and
                Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel

            <name>fantasy</name>
            <description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary
                element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where
                magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation
                that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great
                deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
                In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the
                worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however,
                fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and
                legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
                Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies,
                comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the
                structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on
                the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

            <description>Important characters will have a terrible tendency to die dramatically, but will not, under any
                circumstances, stay dead. This tends to cheapen the dramatic death of a character to the point of being
                little more than a flesh wound if overused. If you ever hear passing mention of any form of afterlife in
                a series, be warned that the value of "dead" has become a whole lot less all of a sudden. Similarly, if
                the entire supporting cast is being killed off left and right, expect a resurrection by the end of the
                current arc. This trope became so common in some series that most people are more likely to be shocked
                if a character does not come back from the dead than when it does.

                This tag is used to demonstrate the unbearable loss, the feeling of losing everything along with every

                losing "his/her paradise" can either be the death/sacrifice of an important character or even a
                betrayal. Usually the anime loses a lot of its former glory afterwards.

            <description>The show does not cover all of the original work (if present) or was cancelled prematurely,
                leaving plot lines unresolved or aborting character development. Sometimes the show runs through all its
                initially slotted episodes and adapts all of the original work (if applicable) but fails to present a
                proper ending, leaving viewers wondering whether they`re missing the final episodes.
                In some cases, this may overlap with the studio forging an anime-original ending. Such an ending
                normally manages to allow the show to "finish", but may still suffer from incomplete story issues.
                An incomplete storyline is not to be confused with the sequel bait, which is when the story presented by
                the show is finished but leaves enough room for a sequel to be produced. Sometimes this goes as far as
                to present a new potential problem in the last few minutes; that is usual for after-credits footage in
                movies.

                true multiple personality disorder.
                The Pai personality is somewhat flaky, but caring and cheerful. The two personae are aware of one

            <description>Undead (Pai`s "Wu").
                Yakumo`s father was an archaeology professor who went to Tibet to study the legend of the Sanjiyans, but
                died a natural death after he met Pai, while he was trying to get out of Yunnan (a province of China,
                near Tibet). Yakumo carries his father`s legacy: the promise to make Pai human.
                At the start of the story he is 17, but later had to quit high school due to the pressures of being an
                immortal. He worked part-time in Culture Shock, a gay bar in Shinjuku (he has no homosexual inclination,
                though). Later, he worked as an employee of Yougekisha.

            <description>The Wu of Kaiyanwang. He assumed command of Kaiyanwang`s demons after his master was sealed
                away by Parvati. He`s spent the last 300 years searching for ways to revive Kaiyanwang from his sealed
                prison. Before becoming a Wu, Benares was a powerful dragon monster who consumed various holy demons.
                This allowed him to absorb enough intelligence to eventually transform himself into the humanoid being
                we see today. Benares is a highly powerful figure within the demon world physically, magically, and
                politically, and strikes fear into even the bravest of souls.
