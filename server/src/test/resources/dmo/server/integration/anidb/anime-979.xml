            Sadness doesn`t necessarily bring more sorrow, it can be the drive to keep you moving, letting you treasure
            what you have left. A touching Tale of Brotherhood, never to be missed!

        <recommendation type="Recommended" uid="481315">Fma on its own is a good anime but not a great one. In the end
            some of the anime only ideas that are introduced are a bit farfetched and in the end ultimately act like a
            parallel universe/alternate timeline to the orignal.
            However when combined with the fmab this series becomes quite an essential one. Fmab during the start is
            quite rushed and character development suffers in the process, fma on the other hand at start is slow paced
            and lots of character development even though if the story is a bit changed.
            So i recommend the fma to anyone, whose planning to keep true to the original story, only for character
            development purposes at the beginning.

        </recommendation>
        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="135233">To describe this anime as a masterpiece would be an understatement.
            You won`t find any other series from the "dark fantasy" genre that will top this. Why? FMA`s complex
            storyline mixes drama and adventure so perfectly that you can`t stop wanting to watch the next episode. The
            characters feel real both in their personalities and motivations. The use of moral philosophy makes this
            series stand out. You really feel the grittiness of war and the corruption of power. This series is an
            adaptation of the manga and while most manga adaptations turn out much inferior than the original; this is
            most definitely not the case with FMA. The story starts to deviate away from the manga story about halfway
            through. Some have said the first 10-13 eps are slow with more dialogue than action. Yes, compared to the
            episodes afterwards, they are slower paced but the reason for this was to build the characters up and
            foreshadow upcoming events.

        <recommendation type="Must See" uid="507844">My two cents says that this anime is a must see. This show consists
            of most incredible elements ever I`ve seen in my life. Which happened to become a great stroke in my whole
            perspective of life either. I`m unable to describe accurately such feeling that whenever I remember this
            show. It`s too efficient and private nonetheless. I can`t recommend it enough, just watch it.

    <description>There exist those with special abilities to manipulate objects and transform them into other objects
        called the Alchemists. However, this manipulation process comes at a price, since the basic alchemy rules state
        that something with equivalent value is needed to perform the manipulation.
        The renowned alchemist http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward Elric] loses his little brother http://anidb.net/ch5908
        [Alphonse] in an accident. Edward manages to contain his brother`s soul in a large piece of armour suit, but by
        doing so Edward loses his arm and leg. And so the brothers set out on a perilous journey to regain their
        original bodies.

            <name>trap</name>
            <description>A trap is a plot device where a male character is mistaken for a female, with the intention of
                sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be intentional by
                the male (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the male, but the occurrence is
                common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
                This is often achieved by portraying the male character as a female; primarily via their clothing and
                physical appearance, but also through his behaviour, and/or language. A male character misinterpreted by
                others as female, without action from the male (explicitly feminine dress or behaviour), is generally

            <name>immortality</name>
            <description>Immortality is the ability to live in a physical or spiritual form for an infinite or
                inconceivably vast length of time. Humans, whose life span is limited and who die of age, disease and
                external trauma, have long sought ways to extend their lives; the Epic of Gilgamesh, considered one of
                the first great literary works created by mankind, is primarily the quest of a hero seeking to become
                immortal. The advances of science, in particular medicine and engineering, and especially in the last
                few centuries, have helped people extend their life span and may yet continue finding ways to do so.
                In fiction, immortals are not quite as uncommon as in real life, and the possible implications of
                endless or very long lives are often explored. Such implications include, but are not limited to:
                repeatedly accompanying the deaths of those dear to them; having to hide their condition from the
                mortals surrounding them; becoming disillusioned with their lives and being unable to kill themselves;
                and even staying forever trapped in the body of a specific physical age, that body most often being that
                of a child. As such, while many may wish for immortality, it may be little more than a curse for the few
                who have it.

            <name>reverse trap</name>
            <description>A reverse trap is a plot device where a female character is mistaken for a male, with the
                intention of sexually deceiving other characters and/or the viewer. This behavior does not need to be
                intentional by the female (it is often not intentional) or continually maintained by the female, but the
                occurrence is common enough to deserve this fetish-specific tag.
                This is often achieved by portraying the female character as a male; primarily via their clothing and
                physical appearance, but also through her behaviour, and/or language. A female character misinterpreted
                by others as male, without action from the female (explicitly masculine dress or behaviour), is
                generally not considered a reverse trap; instead they are likely just http://anidb.net/t2561
                [androgynous].

            <name>loli</name>
            <description>Lolita (often also just abbreviated to loli) refers originally to a novel by Vladimir Nabokov.
                The book is internationally famous for its controversial subject: the narrator and protagonist, middle
                aged Humbert Humbert, becomes obsessed and sexually involved with a 12-year-old girl named Dolores Haze.
                Nowadays the name "Lolita" describes a sexually precocious young girl.
                Related to this is http://anidb.net/t2415 [lolicon], the Japanese abbreviation of the English phrase
                "Lolita Complex". Sometimes written as "roricon" or "rorikon" due to the inexact mapping between
                Japanese and English phonemes. This is the term used to describe the fetish/fascination some mature
                people have for underage girls. There is an entire industry in Japan devoted to providing legal but
                schoolgirl-themed pornography, taking advantage of the cute childlike appearance some Japanese women
                maintain well into their twenties.
                Because the characters in anime are often young by convention, many fans think that a character can only
                be Lolicon if she is twelve or younger. Exceptions are granted if the other character in the
                relationship is a lot older.
                One particular device used to skirt the boundaries of taste and legality is the exotic being (alien,
                creature of magic, robot or the like) which takes the form of an underage human girl, but is in fact for
                all other practical purposes an adult.
                Another reason why lolicon is fetishized by people may be because some of them just view it as a
                substitute for their fetish for flat-chested, but otherwise well-developed, women.

            <description>Some of the central structural elements in anime are:
                Plot Continuity
                How does the plot or several plots unfold. Are they a strictly linear retelling of one big continuing
                story, a serial, possibly with several side stories, or is the content chopped into a set of unconnected
                episodes, only sharing the same setting and characters?
                Stereotype Characters
                Then there is the question of the character set presentation. Is it completely original, or is it your
                usual stereotypical character cast. Both choices have their merit, for example it would not really make
                much sense to reinvent the wheel for a harem anime. Fans of that genre come to expect their favourite
                stereotype protagonists.
                Plot Twists
                Finally there is the question of how complex the plot / the story unfolds. Are there side-plots that
                merge into the main plot leading to unexpected plot twists, or is the anime quite predictable? The
                latter would not be appropriate for detective stories. In harem anime on the other hand a foreseeable
                outcome is actually something the fans will come to expect.

            <name>target audience</name>
            <description>Anime, like everything else in the modern world, is targeted towards specific audiences, both
                implicitly by the creators and overtly by the marketing. While categories are associated with specific
                sex and age groups, this is not a bar on the anime being enjoyed by people who don`t fit into that band;
                not only do crossover titles exist, but the categories also have a considerable following outside their
                main demographic, and a person might as well enjoy anime from all categories. Still, does not invalidate
                the usefulness of marking a title as one of the categories; the same themes will likely be treated
                differently in anime geared for different audiences. Only one should not jump the gun and assume that a
                title will be more or less serious or present content in this or that way due to its target audience, or
                conversely assume the target audience on the content and its presentation alone. As such, the audience
                categories help form a broad impression of how a title might work with the announced themes, but offer
                little to no in-depth information about specific content or its treatment.
                The audience categories originate from manga magazines, which group titles of a same intended audience
                into a magazine that is advertised as belonging to that category, and so manga-based anime will have the
                category from their parent work. As for anime based on other works, the audience is often debatable, but
                comparing information such as time slot to the manga-based anime generally helps figure out the most
                likely possibility.
                If the parent material was classified under multiple audiences over time (for example, it was originally
                shounen, but then as the plot changed and became more mature, it was reclassified as seinen), and the
                anime adapts parent material time periods covering multiple audiences, we tag all audiences covered by
                the anime adaptation.

                a few of the more typical backgrounds for anime plots. Add to that a Conspiracy setting with a possible
                tragic outcome, the Themes span most of the imaginable subject matter relevant to anime.

            <description>Everything under fetishes (except for Bishounen and Juujin) is strictly only meant for hentai
                (18 Restricted) and ecchi anime. In case of ecchi, it must be the main element of the show and not when
                there`s only some of it, for example, there`s some ecchi in Shinseiki Evangelion, but the fact you get
                to see Asuka`s pantsu doesn`t warrant it the schoolgirl fetish category. So be careful to which ecchi
                show you add fetishes; it`s fairly straightforward with hentai, though. Overall, this category tree is
                to satisfy the needs of people with different fetishes, so they can search for what tingles their
                tangle; hence why this is restricted to hentai and full ecchi shows.

            <name>fictional location</name>
            <description>A fictional location is a place or world which is run by different set of rules than our common
                and ordinary world. This may include completely fictional worlds with no semblance of Earth,
                computer-generated worlds, fantasy worlds, magical worlds, parallel worlds accessible through portals,
                and so on. Or it may be fictional places like floating islands, dungeons or planets, which can co-exist
                with ordinary Earth, but are otherwise separate from it.
                A world that generally shares the characteristics of, and/or is generally indistinguishable from the
                real world (bar research on a "more than cursory" level), would NOT be considered a fictional world. A
                good example is http://anidb.net/a4521 [Code Geass]. It contains several real world nationalities, such
                as http://anidb.net/a4521 [China], http://anidb.net/t2672 [Japan] (now Area 11), http://anidb.net/t5091
                [India], etc, along with fictional nationalities such as http://anidb.net/t2361 [Britannia]. China,
                Japan, and India are easily identified with a cursory look. The location is unmistakably the planet
                Earth, even though national borders have been redrawn.
                The fictional world should only be tagged if it plays a materially important role in the plot and
                setting; generally, an episodic occurrence of a fictional world should not be tagged.
                A fantasy world is a type of fictional world, part of a fictional universe. Typical worlds involve, but
                are not limited to: magic or magical abilities, and/or a medieval theme. Some examples include: a
                parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth-like planet
                in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe. Many fantasy
                worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, and sociology, and also on folklore.

            <description>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the densest and fifth-largest of the eight
                planets in the Solar System. It is in effect a ball of hot mud, but on the surface it`s cold enough, so
                most of us live on it (or are supposed to). It is circa 4.5 billion years old, and, unless we humans
                succeed in destroying it over the next couple of centuries, it is expected to last for quite another
                while, though the changes in the Sun`s emissions due to its aging will likely cause the extinction of
                everything; the species of earthlings are guaranteed to die, even if we fail to kill them -- unless, of
                course, we find ourselves another planet and figure out a way to take everything there. Our little
                planet on a corner of this galaxy may mean nothing in the grand scheme of things, but to its inhabitants
                it is their home, so, as a species, we cherish it dearly, to the point many cultures even to this day
                deify it. Being the home to the human civilizations, the Earth is the main setting of most fiction, be
                it anime or otherwise, but not only are many titles set in other places, such as unrelated fantasy
                worlds, in a considerable number of fictional titles the Earth is actually destroyed by aggressive alien
                invaders.

            <description>Human enhancement can take various forms: It can be something comparatively non-intrusive as a
                power-up drug, a form of machine implantation or cyberization (http://anidb.net/a4414 [SAC Solid State
                Society]), or outright - possibly atrocious - genetic manipulation (http://anidb.net/a361 [Ao no 6

            <name>medium awareness</name>
            <description>Medium awareness is the situational and generally temporary awareness characters in works of
                fiction have and display of the very fact that they are characters in works of fiction. For example,
                they may comment about the background music, quip about the script or narration, complain about the
                roles given to them by the writer or their lack of screen time, see the subtitles that appear on screen,
                inform the audience about the arrival of the commercial break, and even use medium effects as tools. The
                most common form of medium awareness is known as breaking the fourth wall, in which characters speak
                directly to the audience, either to it as a whole or to specific members of it. The "fourth wall" is the
                imaginary "wall" at the front of the stage of a proscenium theatre through which the audience sees the
                play; it is a metaphor for the boundary between what happens inside the work, to the characters, and
                outside it, to the audience.

            <name>nudity</name>
            <description>Nudity is the state of wearing no clothing. The wearing of clothing is exclusively a human
                characteristic. The amount of clothing worn depends on functional considerations (such as a need for
                warmth or protection from the elements) and social considerations. In some situations the minimum amount
                of clothing (i.e. covering of a person`s genitals) may be socially acceptable, while in others much more
                clothing is expected.

                People, as individuals and in groups, have varying attitudes towards their own nudity. Some people are
                relaxed about appearing less than fully clothed in front of others, while others are uncomfortable or
                inhibited in that regard. People are nude in a variety of situations, and whether they are prepared to
                disrobe in front of others depends on the social context in which the issue arises. For example, people
                need to bathe without clothing, some people also sleep in the nude, some prefer to sunbathe in the nude
                or at least topless, while others are nude in other situations. Some people adopt naturism as a
                lifestyle.
                Though the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures, some cultures, groups and individuals
                are more relaxed about nudity, though attitudes often depend on context. On the other hand, some people
                feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place
                can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude. Besides meeting
                social disapproval, in some places public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure. Many
                people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency
                and morality. Some people have an psychological aversion to nudity, called gymnophobia. Many people
                regard nudity to be inherently sexual and erotic.
                Nudity is to be found in a multitude of media, including art, photography, film and on the Internet. It
                is a factor in adult entertainment of various types.
                Especially gratuitous fanservice anime shows tend to show their (usually female) characters frequently
                without any clothes, though often hiding genitals through the means of additions like steam.

            <name>magic circles</name>
            <description>A magic circle is circle or sphere of space marked out by practitioners of many branches of
                ritual magic. It may be marked physically, drawn in salt or chalk, for example, or merely visualised.
                Traditionally, circles have been used by ritual magicians to form a protective barrier between
                themselves and what they summoned. Nowadays, circles often have the more benign function of containing
                and concentrating the energy raised during a ritual. Circles can also be used as barriers for
                non-magical work such as meditation.
                Generally, as with most magical practices, an incantation is recited stating the purpose and nature of
                the circle, often repeating an assortment of divine and angelic names.

                It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on
                Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also
                it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and
                Shoujo Kakumei Utena. There are also cases where an anime continues in a manga, as in the case of Angel
                Beats! and Angel Beats: Heaven`s Door, or reverse.

            <description>A parallel world, parallel universe, or alternative reality is a self-contained separate
                reality coexisting with our own. Because "alternative reality" sometimes implies that the reality is a
                variant of our own, like for example a mirror world, we use the term "parallel world/universe" which is
                more general, without any connotations implying a relationship (or lack thereof) with our own
                world/universe (meaning a fictional world can just as well have an alternative reality, it doesn`t need
                to be our reality). To put it more simply, this category is to show if more than 1
                world/universe/reality is present in the anime.
                Multiple timelines of the same world/universe/reality are NOT considered parallel worlds. For example,
                in http://anidb.net/a7729 [Steins;Gate] the cast travels through multiple "World Lines", which are
                defined as parallel timelines of the same universe had various events occurred with differing outcomes.

            <description>Fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic and other supernatural phenomena as a primary
                element of plot, theme, or setting. Many works within the genre take place in fictional worlds where
                magic is common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from science fiction and horror by the expectation
                that it steers clear of (pseudo-)scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great
                deal of overlap between the three (which are subgenres of speculative fiction).
                In popular culture, the genre of fantasy is dominated by its medievalist form, especially since the
                worldwide success of The Lord of the Rings books by J. R. R. Tolkien. In its broadest sense however,
                fantasy comprises works by many writers, artists, filmmakers, and musicians, from ancient myths and
                legends to many recent works embraced by a wide audience today.
                Fantasy is a vibrant area of academic study in a number of disciplines (English, cultural studies,
                comparative literature, history, medieval studies). Work in this area ranges widely, from the
                structuralist theory of Tzvetan Todorov, which emphasizes the fantastic as a liminal space, to work on
                the connections (political, historical, literary) between medievalism and popular culture

            <description>Adventures are exciting stories, with new experiences or exotic locales. Adventures are
                designed to provide an action-filled, energetic experience for the viewer. Rather than the predominant
                emphasis on violence and fighting that is found in pure action anime, however, the viewer of adventures
                can live vicariously through the travels, conquests, explorations, creation of empires, struggles and
                situations that confront the main characters, actual historical figures or protagonists. Under the
                category of adventures, we can include traditional swashbucklers, serialized films, and historical
                spectacles, searches or expeditions for lost continents, "jungle" and "desert" epics, treasure hunts and
                quests, disaster films, and heroic journeys or searches for the unknown. Adventure films are often, but
                not always, set in an historical period, and may include adapted stories of historical or literary
                adventure heroes, kings, battles, rebellion, or piracy.

            <description>Racism is prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of an ethnically
                different background based on the pseudo-scientific belief that biological differences between peoples
                form so-called "races" and that one`s own "race" is superior to another, possibly also holding that
                members of different "races" should be treated differently. Some definitions include only consciously
                malignant forms of discrimination, and some views include discriminatory behaviors and beliefs based on
                cultural, national, ethnic, caste, or religious stereotypes. In works of fiction, this may also include
                similar actions against other sentient species.

            <name>steampunk</name>
            <description>Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that typically features steam-powered machinery,
                especially in a setting inspired by industrialized Western civilization during the 19th century.
                Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century`s British Victorian era or
                American "Wild West", in a post-apocalyptic future during which steam power has regained mainstream use,
                or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.
                Noteworthy attributes of the theme include large amounts smoke pollution from wood or coal burning, the
                affinity to metal constructs like cogs and metal tubing, and the mechanization of everyday objects.
                Steampunk perhaps most recognisably features anachronistic technologies or retro-futuristic inventions
                as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them, and is likewise rooted in the era`s
                perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art.
                Such technology may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules
                Verne, or the modern authors Philip Pullman, Scott Westerfeld, Stephen Hunt and China Miéville. Other
                examples of steampunk contain alternative history-style presentations of such technology as
                lighter-than-air airships, analog computers, or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage`s
                Analytical Engine.
                Steampunk can also exemplify everything that is bad about unrestrained technological progress (dead
                matter), when compared to life and nature. The anime usually makes a point to propound the latter.

                life or the universe. They tend to derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle from

            <description>The conspiracy thriller (or paranoid thriller) is a sub-genre of the thriller which flourished
                in the 1970s in the US (and was echoed in other parts of the world) in the wake of a number of
                high-profile scandals and controversies (most notably Vietnam, the assassination of President Kennedy,
                Chappaquiddick and Watergate), and which exposed what many people regarded as the clandestine
                machinations and conspiracies beneath the orderly fabric of political life.
                The protagonists of conspiracy thrillers are often journalists or amateur investigators who find
                themselves (often inadvertently) pulling on a small thread which unravels a vast conspiracy that
                ultimately goes "all the way to the top".

                a lifelong trip around the world once they hit the tender age of 14, sometimes even earlier.
                Of course this is done because the parents believe their children are independent enough to get their
                act together. But little do they know about the small secrets their offspring has, such as a childhood
                fiancé(e) or even a forbidden incestuous love between their (often not-blood-related) children.
                Of course aside from having a huge house, financial support is provided as well. Usually through the
                means of MAGICAL MONEY.
                In rare cases the parents actually die (shortly) before embarking on their world-trip, which is
                self-evidently used as an important plot device in the development of the child.

            <description>War is a phenomenon of organized violent conflict, typified by extreme aggression, societal
                disruption and adaptation, and high mortality. The objective of warfare differs in accord with a group`s
                role in a conflict: The goals of offensive warfare are typically the submission, assimilation or
                destruction of another group, while the goals of defensive warfare are simply the repulsion of the
                offensive force and, often, survival itself. Relative to each other, combatants in warfare are called
                enemies. The terms military, militant, and militarism each refer to fundamental aspects of war, i.e. the
                organized group, the combative individual, and the supportive ethos (respectively).

            <description>A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land which is usually dry. The European Union
                (EU) Floods Directive defines a flood as a covering by water of land not normally covered by water. In
                the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Flooding may occur
                as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river or lake, in which the water overtops or
                breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an
                accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. While the size of a lake or other body
                of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are
                unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.

                coup, a putsch, or an overthrow, is the sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated
                by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it
                with a new ruling body. A coup d`état is considered successful when the usurpers establish their
                dominance. If a coup fails, a civil war may ensue.

            <description>A Splatter film or Gore film is a sub-genre of horror film that deliberately focuses on graphic
                portrayals of gore and graphic violence. These films, through the use of special effects and excessive
                blood and guts, tend to display an overt interest in the vulnerability of the human body and the
                theatricality of its mutilation. Due to their willingness to portray images society might consider
                shocking, splatter films share some ideological grounds with the transgressive art movement. The term
                "splatter cinema" was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film Dawn of the Dead, though Dawn of
                the Dead is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than
                to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

                established authority such as a government, governor, president, political leader, financial
                institution, or person in charge. On the one hand the forms of behaviour can include non-violent methods
                such as the (overlapping but not quite identical) phenomena of civil disobedience, civil resistance and
                nonviolent resistance. On the other hand it may encompass violent campaigns. Those who participate in
                rebellions, especially if they are armed rebellions, are known as "rebels".&#13;

                It keeps the main characters obsessed with promises that they made when they were children, mostly

            <description>The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins, is a grouping and
                classification of vices of Christian origin. Behaviors or habits are classified under this category if
                they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed,
                lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth, which are also contrary to the seven virtues. These sins are
                often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one`s natural faculties or passions (for example,
                gluttony abuses one`s desire to eat).

            <description>Family values are traditional or cultural values, generally conservative in nature, that
                pertain to the family`s structure, function, roles, beliefs, attitudes, and ideals. They encompass a set
                of beliefs, the most common of which is the classical "traditional family" involving a middle-class
                family with a breadwinner father and a homemaker mother, raising their biological children.
                According to Merriam-Webster, family values are "values especially of a traditional or conservative kind

            <description>The title of Philip K. Dick`s SF novel (movie: Blade Runner).
                The phrase implies a set of existential questions: Do artificial beings (e.g. Replicants, Bioroids, or
                other AI constructs) dream, feel, or have a soul? If memories can be implanted, what makes real memories
                real? By contrast — what makes humans human? What is reality?
                These are central themes e.g. in all of the Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed series / movies.

                This plot device adds a certain degree of tragedy to the anime, and usually has repercussions on the

                oldest daughter has an extra burden of raising the other children, additional emphasis is given to the
                only female child in the family, i.e. with bishounen brother and dad in a shoujo setting.
                In rare cases the mother may still be alive, just not living with the rest of the family presently, i.e.
                on some quest or job and gone for a long time.

                assemblage, share a common identity. In current usage it typically denotes a criminal organization or
                else a criminal affiliation. In early usage, the word gang referred to a group of workmen. In the United
                Kingdom the word is still often used in this sense, but it later underwent pejoration. The word gang
                often carries a negative connotation; however, within a gang which defines itself in opposition to
                mainstream norms, members may adopt the phrase as a statement of identity or defiance.
                The word "gang" derives from the past participle of Old English gan "to go". It is cognate with Old
                Norse gangr, meaning "journey."

                not have English as their primary language of origin (such as Japanese or Chinese). Occasionally
                characters in the original Japanese dialogue version of an anime will speak in English... however; this
                often still requires the assistance of subtitles, for while the words are meant to be said in English,
                the sentence structure and letter pronunciation may still be strongly related to the person’s primary
                language.

            <name>human sacrifice</name>
            <description>Human sacrifice is the act of killing one or more human beings as part of a ritual. Throughout
                the majority of human history, primitive societies have engaged in human sacrifice, generally as a
                religious act, such as an offering to please or appease deities, spirits, or the deceased. Other uses
                that have been seen include magic rituals, usually related to black magic or the summoning of demons.

            <description>Torture involves the deliberate act of inflicting pain, to either fulfill a desire of the
                torturer, or apply coercion to compel action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a knowing and
                intentional act; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict pain without a specific intent to do so
                are not typically considered torture.
                This is distinct from http://anidb.net/t2905 [erotic torture], which is generally for the purpose of
                using (almost) any form of physical or excessive psychological abuse to inflict physical and/or mental
                pain, with the goal of inducing sexual pleasure.

                Al`s blood seal lies just below the base of the neck at the back of the suit, on the inside. It is drawn
                with Ed`s blood. According to Edward, he needs to be careful whenever he reconstructs Alphonse`s body
                because he must keep the blood seal intact during the transmutation. If the blood seal is removed, Al`s
                soul will be lost.

            <description>Alex Louis Armstrong, the "Strong Arm Alchemist," is a large and comically emotional State
                Alchemist who will burst into tears or joyous praise, given the right situation, and embraces others in
                an effort to console them. Because he is an extremely strong character, this usually causes great
                personal injury to others. Armstrong is very proud of his strength and of his muscular physique,
                frequently taking off his shirt so that he can flex for the benefit of others. As a final element of his
                comedic properties, he has the tendency to "sparkle"; when first appearing in a scene or taking off his
                shirt, pink stars radiate from his body. Despite his humorous tendencies, Armstrong can be very serious
                when the situation calls for it. He is not fond of violence and will try to end conflicts peacefully,
                and will break down and cry if an innocent person is killed.
                Armstrong comes from a wealthy family of aristocrats who have earned renown in most professions. He has
                mastered many of his family`s talents for himself, and when displaying such a talent, he remarks it to
                have been "passed down the Armstrong line for generations." His alchemical skills also represent a
                remnant of his family`s history; by using a unique kind of brass knuckles, Armstrong can reshape any
                solid object that he punches. Armstrong is a valuable ally of http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang] and
                the Elric brothers, even if they are not always happy to be in his emotional company. He takes his honor
                as a soldier and as a leader seriously, and always looks out for his peers` and subordinates` best
                interests.

                Mustang about his family. After his daughter, http://anidb.net/ch10890 [Elicia], is born, he fawns about
                how cute and talented she is and bombards others with pictures of her when he sees them. Despite his
                over-the-top comical tendencies, Hughes is a valuable ally to Mustang`s goal of becoming Führer,
                supplying whatever classified intelligence that may be beneficial. He has also been shown to be a
                capable fighter, skilled with throwing knives. His general understanding of others` emotions and desire
                to help them similarly gains the affection of the Elric brothers and their friend
                http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry Rockbell], as he always offers advice or hospitality to them when they
                need it.

            <description>Envy is a genderless (though is referred to as `he` as well as `it`) homunculus who has the
                ability of shape-shifting. It uses this power to assume the form of any person and even copy their
                voice.
                Envy is most comfortable in the "adorable" and "beautiful" form of an androgynous teenager. It usually
                serves as a spy, but abilities are also extremely useful for assassinations, as demonstrated by the
                murder of http://anidb.net/ch6590 [Maes Hughes]. Envy`s most frequently used assassination technique is
                to impersonate someone whom the target loved or cared about, and use the target`s hesitation as an
                opportunity to kill him or her. Envy may not be as smart as some of the other Homunculi, but is by no
                means an idiot. In fact, it can be just as good a puppet master as http://anidb.net/ch6591 [Lust]. But
                this is overshadowed by its cockiness and bad temper. Its temper can easily be set off by insulting his
                large and delicate ego, causing it to make mistakes.

                and their two sons behind to find a way to escape his immortality and achieve this goal. Trisha tries to
                last until his return, though she ultimately dies of an illness. http://anidb.net/ch42761 [Ed] and
                http://anidb.net/ch42762 [Al] attempt to revive her with human transmutation, but instead create a
                malformed entity that dies within moments of being created. Hohenheim would later plant the suggestion
                that the creature was not the actual Trisha, leading to the conclusion it was Alphonse possessing an
                artificially created body momentarily after losing his own. In the first anime series, the failed
                creation becomes the homunculus http://anidb.net/ch19254 [Sloth].

                brothers` arrival in town opens Rose`s eyes to the church`s corruption and forces her to realize her
                boyfriend is not coming back. Rose does not appear again until much later in the series. In the manga
                she helps to rebuild the town, eventually reuniting with http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse Elric]. In
                the anime she instead becomes the mute "Holy Mother" of the townspeople, giving them a symbol of
                guidance as they rise up against the State Military. Rose loses her voice after being captured by a
                soldier of the military.

            <description>Sheska is a mousy, bespectacled young woman who had previously worked in the National Central
                Library in Central City, but was fired for spending her time reading books instead of doing her job.
                http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric seek her out to discover
                whether or not http://anidb.net/ch10165 [Tim Marcoh]`s research journal had been located in the
                library`s First Branch, which had been burnt down. After finding her trapped in her home under a
                collapsed mountain of books, Sheska confirms the Elrics` worst fears - that the book, which she herself
                had read cover to cover, had indeed been in the First Branch and, therefore, destroyed.
                But, as they leave, visibly disheartened, Sheska reveals that she has a photographic memory and can
                recreate the book for them, exactly as it had looked when she read it. As a result, Sheska is able to
                recreate Marcoh`s notes in five days to such a degree of detail that, even though Marcoh wrote them in
                code, Edward is able to decipher their hidden truth.
                When http://anidb.net/ch6590 [Maes Hughes] reveals that several court-martial records had been kept in
                the First Branch, Edward and Alphonse recommend Sheska for the task of recreating them, as she had read
                them as well. Thanks to this, Sheska is hired into the Amestrian military at a desk job in the records
                department.

                became a human test subject in the military`s alchemical experiments and, in lieu of execution, had his
                disembodied soul bound to a suit of armor, similar to http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse Elric]. As a

                bodies of nearby Central Prison`s death row inmates. They had their souls bound to a single suit of
                armor by way of a pair of blood runes (one in the helm and one in the armor`s neckpiece) and were
                assigned to kill any intruders at the laboratory. Prior to their official "execution" about two years

                killer "Slicer" who, when finally captured, was discovered to have been a pair of murdering brothers.

            <description>Yoki is, when first introduced, a corrupt member of the military who imposes heavy taxes on the
                town of Youswell, bankrupting its citizens. When the Elric brothers arrive in town, they trick Yoki into
                giving up ownership of the town and promptly report his actions to the military. He is stripped of his
                rank and lives as a homeless person on the outskirts of Central, where he meets the fugitive
                http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar].
                In the 2003 anime, Yoki alerts the military to Scar`s location, and in the subsequent raid to apprehend
                Scar he is killed by http://anidb.net/ch6591 [Lust].
                In the manga, Yoki is forced to work for Scar under the threat of death. Though he tries to convince
                those they encounter that Scar is his servant, Yoki does as Scar commands and calls him "master". Since
                he has started following Scar around the country, Yoki has assumed a role as comic relief, often having
                pain inflicted upon him when he tries to seem superior to others. In Chapter 93, Yoki manages to hit
                Pride with http://anidb.net/ch14594 [Kimblee]`s car buying http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] and

                because everyone else "gets all the cool parts".

            <description>Izumi Curtis is a skilled martial artist and alchemist living in the southern Amestrian town of
                Dublith where - with her husband http://anidb.net/ch10173 [Sig Curtis] - she runs a butcher shop. Though
                she doesn`t usually take on students, Izumi accepted http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and
                http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric`s plea to accept them as her apprentices and instructed them in
                alchemical theory and practice for six months.
                Although Izumi takes apparent pride in being a housewife and introduces herself as such to anyone who
                asks, her attractive and humble exterior belies a fearsome disposition such that Ed and Al become
                terrified at the mere thought of her.
                She is prone to swift acts of violence and is often seen doling out physical harm, though most acts of
                overexertion on her part are followed by a regurgitation of blood linked to an internal injury from a
                failed Human Transmutation several years before. As a result of this, she is one of the few characters
                able to perform alchemy without the aid of a Transmutation Circle. Izumi is among the strongest women
                (and indeed characters) in the series.
                She also appears to enjoy travel (a trait she may have passed on to Edward), as many of her appearances
                in the series find her journeying outside her hometown. She even announces herself as a "travelling
                housewife".

            <description>Sig is the large, doting husband of http://anidb.net/ch10172 [Izumi Curtis]. Together with his
                wife, he runs a Meat shop in Dublith and housed http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and
                http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric during their alchemy apprenticeship, though he himself is not
                an alchemist. Despite his perpetually angry-looking face, Sig is quite a nice person and laments the
                repellent nature of his visage. He is very devoted to and protective of Izumi, constantly worrying about
                her bad health and often needlessly rushing to her rescue when he senses danger (as he did when she was
                approached by Ulchi at Devil`s Nest and when she was "stabbed" by Van Hohenheim ) and becoming jealous
                when Izumi speaks fondly of other men. He has also been shown to be able to sleep with his eyes wide
                open. Sig has mentioned that he blames himself for not realizing sooner that Izumi had been
                experimenting with Human Transmutation.

            <description>Greed is a greedy Homunculus, called the "Ultimate Shield", because he can rearrange the carbon
                in his body to make his skin as hard as diamond, thus making himself almost impossible to injure. As his
                name implies, he is a very avaricious character, who likes living in luxury, surrounded by powerful
                minions and beautiful women. He also has a habit of flipping people off in the manga. Despite his
                generally greedy nature, he is shown to honestly care for his subordinates.

            <description>Führer King Bradley is the head of the State Military and King of Amestris. Though initially
                portrayed as a kindly ruler, he is later revealed to be a homunculus. Though his identity as a
                homunculus differs between the manga and first anime series (he is the homonculus Wrath in the manga and
                the 2009 anime adaptation, and Pride in the 2003 anime), his weapon of choice is the sword, which he
                wields with great proficiency. His deadly swordsmanship is further augmented by the "Ultimate Eye," a
                clairvoyant eye that bears the Ouroboros seal, which is usually covered by an eyepatch. The eye gives
                him the foresight to see all possible outcomes of a given situation, allowing him to predict the moves
                of any opponent before they happen, along with being able to see things the normal human eye can not,
                such as air currents. In both story lines, because homunculi cannot reproduce, Bradley is given a family
                to keep up appearances: his son, http://anidb.net/ch14960 [Selim Bradley], and a wife he personally
                chose.

                allowing him to act as a sort of recording device that does not leave any physical evidence. Because his
                intellect is his area of expertise, he does not have much experience in the field, causing him to make
                rookie mistakes when in a combat situation. He is overly formal, causing some of his comrades to wish he
                would lighten up.

            <description>Elicia Hughes is the young daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes and his wife Gracia. The
                apple of the Lt. Colonel`s eye, Elicia and her apparently unfathomable adorableness are the subject of
                just about all Maes` casual conversation and grace her father`s presence in the form of a photograph
                that he carries everywhere and shows to almost everyone.
                In the manga, Elicia first appears in Chapter 14, when Winry Rockbell visits Central City and is
                practically kidnapped to the young girl`s third birthday party by Maes. Fumbling precociously over her
                numbers and being genuinely enthusiastic, she manages to win over Winry as well, who begins to see the
                toddler as a baby sister.
                When Maes dies, Elicia is both confused and devastated and demands sadly at the funeral that the strange
                men stop burying her papa so that he can return to loving her and his job. Though Elicia`s protests
                break the hearts of most of the present mourners (as well as fans of the series), it is revealed later
                that Wrath was merely trembling from the strong desire to quiet her by force.
                She appears again in Chapter 36, when (after hearing about Maes` murder) Winry returns to the Hughes
                residence to speak with Gracia. Though a significant amount of time has passed, it is clear that little
                Elicia has not yet managed to comprehend the finality of her father`s death, as she responds to Winry`s
                knock at the door with an enthusiastic "Papa!" before somberly realizing her mistake.
                Despite this, Elicia retains her innocence, greeting her surrogate older sister with love and comforting
                her mourning mother.
                In the 2003 anime series, Elicia is introduced during the flashback to Edward`s preparation for the
                State Alchemy Examinations. In place of the character Satella Lecoulte from the manga, Gracia is the one
                introduced as pregnant in the first anime series. During a snowstorm in midwinter, Gracia goes into
                labor and while Maes goes to fetch the doctor, Ed, Alphonse and Nina Tucker must tend to Gracia and help
                deliver the baby, making the three of them present for Elicia`s birth, which just so happens to coincide
                with Edward`s birthday.

            <description>Solf J. Kimblee, the "Red Lotus Alchemist" (sometimes referred to as the "Crimson Alchemist")
                is a former State Alchemist and special agent working under the direct orders of
                http://anidb.net/ch10175 [Führer King Bradley]. Admittedly sadistic and arguably psychopathic, Kimblee
                was imprisoned in Central City for several years after his official involvement in the Ishval Civil War
                for having infamously turned his unique brand of combustion-based combat alchemy on people who were not
                on his government-approved kill list. Due to conspiratorial acts at the top of government, Kimblee is
                officially exonerated of his crimes so as to serve as the Führer`s hidden left hand in the secret
                battles to come.
                As a result of the schism between the storylines of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and the 2003 anime
                series, Solf J. Kimblee appears prominently in both but is a rather different character in each.

                creating secure lines and tapping into others. He is transferred to Southern Headquarters when Mustang`s
                group is broken up by the homunculi. In the manga, he eventually defects from the military so that he
                can help Mustang overthrow http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley].

                subordinates. He is usually seen smoking a cigarette, something that Arakawa developed prior to the
                series` start to help Mustang to create fire to fight homunculus Lust. He was recruited by Mustang for
                his loyalty and general sincerity, as well as his above average shooting skills. Because working for
                Mustang requires moving frequently and a complete dedication of time, Havoc has very little free time,
                and cannot maintain a relationship with a woman for very long.

            <description>Lieutenant General Grumman is http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Colonel Roy Mustang]`s commanding
                officer and mentor at East City headquarters. He plays chess with Roy Mustang when the transfer to
                central has came for Roy, Roy then bests the Lieutenant General in a game of chess to which the General
                gives him the board (And pieces) as a farewell gift.
                He is an old man that takes a lighthearted approach to his command. When Roy Mustang transfers from
                Eastern Headquarters to Central, Grumman authorizes the transfer of Mustang`s subordinates, including
                his granddaughter http://anidb.net/ch6587 [Riza Hawkeye] (though it is unknown if she is aware of this
                relationship). After the Homunculi strip Mustang of his subordinates, he calls for Grumman`s aid.
                Grumman, not under the Homunculi`s surveillance, acts on Mustang`s behalf in intelligence gathering and
                communication, going as far as dressing up like an old woman to not be spotted in Central. Though a
                willing and powerful ally, he is reluctant to openly work against the military; as being branded a
                traitor would make it difficult to become the next leader of Amestris.
                It is implied in a joke that Grumman doesn`t do anything in the East City Headquaters when he says to
                Roy: "Now that your transfer to central has become final, I may have to start doing things around here
                again.", although this may just be an inside joke between the two. Grumman makes a brief cameo in
                Conqueror of Shamballa. He is implied to have replaced http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley] as the
                leader of Amestris.

            <description>Her parents died in a Train crash when she was young. She lost both of her legs in the crash
                (and, in the first anime, also lost one arm). Dominic took her in as his daughter and took care of her.
                He gave her automail limbs to replace the ones she lost.
                The manga version of Paninya has her lose both her legs in a train accident at a young age. Dominic
                takes pity on her and fits her with two new automail legs, one of which conceals a carbon blade while
                the other, a 1.5 inch carbine. Paninya first encounters the Elrics on their trip to Rush Valley. After
                robbing http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Ed] of his State Alchemist pocketwatch and leading him in a chase all
                over the city, Paninya is caught by http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry] and forced to return the watch in
                return for introducing the young automail engineer to Dominic.
                Paninya appears again on the Elrics` return trip to Rush Valley and aids in their capture of
                http://anidb.net/ch10402 [Ling]`s retainers, http://anidb.net/ch10406 [Lan Fan] &amp;
                http://anidb.net/ch10405 [Fuu].
                Paninya has mentioned that she has a low tolerance for blood and is made uncomfortable by the sight of
                it.

            <description>Scar`s brother is a minor character in the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, and appears in the
                manga version and both anime versions of the story. He is responsible for saving his brother`s life
                during the war in Ishval, sacrificing himself and giving away his right arm, which later allows
                http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar] to kill state alchemists. He is never seen in the present time as he died
                during the Ishval Massacre, but he is seen in several flashbacks. Like his brother, his name has never
                been revealed.

            <charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
            <description>Wrath differs greatly in the first anime and in the manga. In the manga and second anime, Wrath
                is the true identity of King Bradley. The first anime shows the origins of Wrath in Izumi Curtis`s
                attempt to revive her infant child. Her effort failed, and the infant`s body was taken beyond the Gate
                of Truth. There, the child, Wrath, grew up. When Edward Elric later lost his arm and leg while trying to
                revive his mother, Wrath took both for himself, which allowed him to use alchemy and escape to Amestris.
                Because of his ability to perform alchemy, Wrath can assimilate any sort of material or object into his
                body. Since the remains of his former body were used in his creation, Wrath lacks the weaknesses of the
                other homunculi, though both the Gate of Truth and the cries of a child have similar psychological
                effects on him. His Ouroboros tattoo is under his right foot,

            <charactertype id="1">Character</charactertype>
            <description>Sloth differs greatly in the first anime and in the manga and second anime. In the manga and
                the second anime, Sloth is a large, muscular, dim-witted man who believes everything to be pointless and
                tiresome.
                In the first anime, Sloth was the product of Elric brothers` attempt to revive their mother, Trisha
                Elric, found by Dante and Envy while the horrified Elrics went to the Rockbell residence for help. Once
                able to assume her original form`s likeness, Sloth was able to assume a watery composition, which she
                uses to drown others by grabbing hold of them. In spite of it, Sloth constantly suffers from memories of
                Trisha raising the Elric brothers. Determined to prove to herself that those are Trisha`s memories and
                not her own, she longs to be able to kill the brothers, as a real mother could never kill her own sons.
                She develops a mother-son relationship with Wrath, and the two stick together during the second half of
                the first anime. During a battle with the Elric brothers, Wrath, having merged with Trisha`s remains
                earlier, merges with Sloth`s body so that he will never have to be separated from her. This leaves Sloth
                paralysed, allowing Edward Elric an easy opportunity to convert the water in her body into ethanol,
                which then evaporates into the atmosphere.
